## What is the paper about?  

When is the right moment to deliver digital mental health support?  

üì± We developed and piloted a **Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI)** designed to help people with depressive symptoms activate their social support networks in daily life.  

The study compared two triggering approaches:  
- **Emotion dynamics** (e.g., increases in distress)  
- **Self-reported support need**  

Findings show that interventions triggered by **support need** were rated as more helpful and timely than those triggered by distress dynamics.  

In the paper, we also report on:
- High feasibility: 85% survey compliance, low attrition, minimal tech issues  
- Barriers like time constraints and unavailable support providers remain important challenges 

This pilot highlights the importance of aligning JITAI timing with participant-expressed needs, contributing to ongoing discussions about ‚Äúwhat is just-in-time?‚Äù in **JITAIs** and **Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMIs)**.
