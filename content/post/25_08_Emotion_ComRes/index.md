## What are the papers about?  

How does everyday smartphone use affect young adults’ momentary well-being, and how do digital interactions compare to face-to-face ones in their effects on momentary well-being? Two new papers explore these questions with experience sampling data:  

- In the *Emotion* paper, we investigate **bidirectional associations between smartphone use and momentary well-being** (affect, loneliness) by combining passive smartphone log data with experience sampling. Across three samples, associations were generally weak, but social media use was significantly -- but weakly -- associated to subsequent increases in loneliness. This pattern, however, was particularly strong among individuals with higher baseline loneliness, suggesting a heightened social media sensitivity.

- In the paper published in *Communication Research*, we examine **day-to-day social interactions online and offline** using ecological momentary assessments. Results indicate that interaction quality, rather than the interaction mode itself (online vs offline), is consistently associated with higher momentary well-being. The study highlights the value of intensive longitudinal designs for advancing our understanding of how everyday social experiences shape well-being.

Together, these studies advance our understanding of how digital technologies shape social and mental well-being in everyday life.
