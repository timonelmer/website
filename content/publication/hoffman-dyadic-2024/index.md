abstract: Dyadic isolation is the tendency of some individuals to be involved in pairwise
  interactions rather than in larger group interactions. This article investigates
  the interpersonal processes associated with the dyadic isolation of individuals
  with depressive symptoms. We hypothesize that such individuals tend to initiate
  more and stay longer in dyadic interactions compared to group interactions (dyadic
  preference hypothesis) and that individuals—irrespective of their own level of depressive
  symptoms—tend to join and stay longer in interactions when interaction partners
  have lower levels of depressive symptoms (depression avoidance hypothesis). We analyze
  two data sets (N = 123) of face-to-face interaction events (N = 86,915) collected
  with proximity badges at a social event. Hypotheses are tested using a relational
  event model (DyNAM-i) specifically tailored for modeling group interactions. In
  line with the dyadic preference hypotheses, individuals with higher levels of depressive
  symptoms are found to be more likely to join and stay in dyadic interactions. Post
  hoc analyses reveal that this result only applies to female participants. We find
  limited support for the depression avoidance hypotheses.
