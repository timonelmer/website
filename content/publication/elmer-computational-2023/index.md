abstract: Puberty is a phase in which individuals often test the boundaries of themselves
  and surrounding others and further deﬁne their identity – and thus their uniqueness
  compared to other individuals. Similarly, as Computational Social Science (CSS)
  grows up, it must strike a balance between its own practices and those of neighboring
  disciplines to achieve scientiﬁc rigor and reﬁne its identity. However, there are
  certain areas within CSS that are reluctant to adopt rigorous scientiﬁc practices
  from other ﬁelds, which can be observed through an overreliance on passively collected
  data (e.g., through digital traces, wearables) without questioning the validity
  of such data. This paper argues that CSS should embrace the potential of combining
  both passive and active measurement practices to capitalize on the strengths of
  each approach, including objectivity and psychological quality. Additionally, the
  paper suggests that CSS would beneﬁt from integrating practices and knowledge from
  other established disciplines, such as measurement validation, theoretical embedding,
  and open science practices. Based on this argument, the paper provides ten recommendations
  for CSS to mature as an interdisciplinary ﬁeld of research.
