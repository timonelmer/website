abstract: Adolescents with chronic pain (ACP) often experience impairments in their
  social functioning. Little is known about the consequences of these impairments
  on peer relationships of ACP. This study applied social network analysis to examine
  whether adolescents with more pain problems are less popular (RQ1), adolescents
  with similar pain problems name each other more often as being part of the same
  peer group (RQ2), dyads with an adolescent experiencing more pain problems report
  less positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) friendship qualities
  (RQ3), and positive and negative friendship qualities moderate the relationship
  between pain and emotional distress (RQ4). This study used data from the first wave
  of a longitudinal study (N 5 2767) which followed up Swedish adolescents from 19
  public schools. For RQ1-3, Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure was
  applied. For RQ4, standard multilevel models with observations of adolescents nested
  within schools were estimated. Results showed that ACP were not less popular than
  adolescents without chronic pain. Second, ACP nominated each other more often as
  being part of the same peer group. Third, results regarding friendship quality showed
  that adolescents with more pain problems perceived the relationship with their friends
  as less positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) than adolescents
  with less pain problems. Finally, positive and negative friendship qualities moderated
  the relationship between pain and emotional distress. This study contributes to
  the literature on the importance of peer relationships of ACP. Clinical implications
  and directions for future research are discussed.
