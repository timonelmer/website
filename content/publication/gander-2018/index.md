abstract: Successful teamwork is an important factor for positive outcomes at the
  organizational and the individual level. Best results should be expected when every
  team member can contribute his or her specific set of strengths and skills, with
  all of the necessary skills being present in a team. Recently a new model of team
  roles developed from a positive psychological perspective has been suggested comprising
  of 7 informal team roles. The present study examines the relevance of role-fit between
  roles displayed in the current team and roles displayed in an ideal team on a person's
  job satisfaction and calling. For this purpose, a sample of N = 342 employed participants
  who took part in an online survey were analyzed. Results show that most current
  team roles contribute to job satisfaction and calling, whereas only few relationships
  are found with ideal roles. Further, the interplay between current and ideal role
  behavior is relevant for job satisfaction in most team roles, but only for few roles
  with regard to calling. Thus, both current and ideal team roles are relevant for
  work-related outcomes; this information could potentially be used as a starting
  point for positive interventions at the workplace. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)
