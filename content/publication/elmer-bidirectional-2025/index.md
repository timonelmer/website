abstract: Given the pervasive role of smartphones in modern life, research into their
  impact on well-being has ﬂourished. This study addresses existing methodological
  shortcomings using smartphone log data and experience sampling methods (ESM) to
  explore the bidirectional within-person relationship between smartphone usage and
  momentary well-being variables (i.e., affect valence, loneliness, positive affect,
  and negative affect). We further examine different categories of smartphone usage,
  namely, communication, social media, and other apps. We analyze three samples (N1
  = 225, N2 = 17, N3 = 13; with T1 = 7,874, T2 = 2,566, T3 = 1,533 ESM reports) with
  multilevel models to test our preregistered hypotheses. Data for Sample I were collected
  in Spain in 2022 (82% female; Mage = 23.1). Samples II and III (80% female; Mage
  = 21.6) were collected in the Netherlands between 2021 and 2022. Our results suggest
  that smartphone usage within an hour before ESM assessment, especially using social
  media apps, is associated with reduced affect valence and increased loneliness on
  a within-person level. Loneliness was associated with more smartphone usage than
  usual, particularly the use of social media apps, within the hour following ESM
  assessments. However, overall, our ﬁndings indicate weak bidirectional associations
  between smartphone usage and indicators of momentary well-being (range standardized
  β = .00–.08). On the between-person level, those individuals generally high in loneliness
  were more affected in their momentary loneliness by prior social media use, suggesting
  a heightened social media sensitivity. The interplay between social media use and
  momentary loneliness should be studied in more detail, including contextual factors
  and experimental designs.
