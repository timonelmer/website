abstract: Treatment pressure restricts patients' voluntary and autonomous decisions.
  Yet interventions involving treatment pressure are widely used in mental health
  and psychosocial services. This cross-sectional study explored whether mental health
  professionals' knowledge on five types of treatment pressure (no coercion, persuasion
  or conviction, leverage, threat, and formal coercion) was associated with sociodemographic,
  professional and contextual factors. A more positive attitude towards interventions
  involving treatment pressure was associated with underrating the level of those
  interventions compared with a predefined default value. The treatment setting and
  professional group played a minor role in 'leverage' and 'formal coercion' types
  of treatment pressure, respectively.
