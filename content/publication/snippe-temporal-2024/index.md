abstract: 'Objective: Despite the importance for understanding mechanisms of change,
  little is known about the order of change in daily life emotions, cognitions, and
  behaviors during treatment of depression. This study examined the within-person
  temporal order of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral improvements using ecological
  momentary assessment data. Method: Thirty-two individuals with diagnosed depression
  completed ecological momentary assessment questions on emotions (sad mood, happy
  mood), behaviors (social interaction, number of activities), and cognitive variables
  (worrying, negative self-thoughts) 5 times a day during a 4-month period in which
  they underwent psychotherapy for depression. Nonparametric change-point analyses
  were used to determine the timing of gains (i.e., improvements in the mean of each
  variable) for each individual. We then established whether the first (i.e., earliest)
  gains in emotions preceded, followed, or occurred in the same week as cognitive
  and behavioral gains for each individual. Results: Contrary to our hypotheses, first
  gains in behaviors did not precede first emotional gains (3 times, 8%) more often
  than they followed them (26 times, 70%). Cognitive gains often occurred in the same
  week as first emotional gains (43 times, 58%) and less often preceded (13 times,
  18%) or followed emotional gains (18 times, 24%). Conclusion: The first improvements
  in behaviors did not tend to precede the first improvements in emotions likely because
  fewer behavioral gains were found. The finding that cognitive variables tend to
  improve around the same time as sad mood may explain why many studies failed to
  find that cognitive change predicts later change in depressive symptoms. (PsycInfo
