abstract: 'The social context of a person, meaning their social relationships and
  daily social interactions, is an important factor for understanding their mental
  health. However, personalised feedback approaches to psychotherapy do not consider
  this factor sufficiently yet. Therefore, we developed an interactive feedback prototype
  focusing specifically on a person’s social relationships as captured with personal
  social networks (PSN) and daily social interactions as captured with experience
  sampling methodology (ESM). We describe the development of the prototype as well
  as two evaluation studies: Semistructured interviews with students (N = 23) and
  a focus group discussion with five psychotherapy patients. Participants from both
  studies considered the prototype useful. The students considered participation in
  our study, which included social context assessment via PSN and ESM as well as a
  feedback session, insightful. However, it remains unclear how much insight the feedback
  procedure generated for the students beyond the insights they already gained from
  the assessments. The focus group patients indicated that in a clinical context,
  (social context) feedback may be especially useful to generate insight for the clinician
  and facilitate collaboration between patient and clinician. Furthermore, it became
  clear that the current feedback prototype requires explanations by a researcher
  or trained clinician and cannot function as a stand-alone intervention. As such,
  we discuss our feedback prototype as a starting point for future research and clinical
  implementation.'
