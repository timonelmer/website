abstract: "Academic success of students has been explained with a variety of individual\
  \ and socioeconomic factors. Social networks that informally emerge within student\
  \ communities can have an additional effect on their achievement. However, this\
  \ effect of social ties is difficult to measure and quantify, because social networks\
  \ are multidimensional and dynamically evolving within the educational context.\
  \ We repeatedly surveyed a cohort of 226 engineering undergraduates between their\
  \ first day at university and a crucial examination at the end of the academic year.\
  \ We investigate how social networks emerge between previously unacquainted students\
  \ and how integration in these networks explains academic success. Our study measures\
  \ multiple important dimensions of social ties between students: their positive\
  \ interactions, friendships, and studying relations. By using statistical models\
  \ for dynamic network data, we are able to investigate the processes of social network\
  \ formation in the cohort. We find that friendship ties informally evolve into studying\
  \ relationships over the academic year. This process is crucial, as studying together\
  \ with others, in turn, has a strong impact on students' success at the examination.\
  \ The results are robust to individual differences in socioeconomic background factors\
  \ and to various indirect measures of cognitive abilities, such as prior academic\
  \ achievement and being perceived as smart by other students. The findings underline\
  \ the importance of understanding social network dynamics in educational settings.\
  \ They call for the creation of university environments promoting the development\
  \ of positive relationships in pursuit of academic success."
