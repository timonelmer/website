 abstract = {Causal inference methods for treatment eﬀect estimation usually assume independent units. However, this assumption is often questionable because units may interact, resulting in spillover eﬀects between them. We develop augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) for estimation and inference of the expected average treatment eﬀect (EATE) with observational data from a single (social) network with spillover eﬀects. In contrast to overall eﬀects such as the global average treatment eﬀect, the EATE measures, in expectation and on average over all units, how the outcome of a unit is causally aﬀected by its own treatment, marginalizing over the spillover eﬀects from other units. We develop cross-ﬁtting theory with plugin machine learning to obtain a semiparametric treatment eﬀect estimator that converges at the parametric rate and asymptotically follows a Gaussian distribution. The asymptotics are developed using the dependency graph rather than the network graph, which makes explicit that we allow for spillover eﬀects beyond immediate neighbors in the network. We apply our AIPW method to the Swiss StudentLife Study data to investigate the eﬀect of hours spent studying on exam performance accounting for the students’ social network.},
