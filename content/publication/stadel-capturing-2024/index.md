abstract: The daily social life of a person can be captured with different methodologies.
  Two methods that are especially promising are personal-social-network (PSN) data
  collection and experience-sampling methodology (ESM). Whereas PSN data collections
  ask participants to provide information on their social relationships and broader
  social environment, ESM studies collect intensive longitudinal data on social interactions
  in daily life using multiple short surveys per day. In combination, the two methods
  enable detailed insights into someone?s social life, including information on interactions
  with specific interaction partners from the personal network. Despite many potential
  uses of such data integration, there are few studies to date using the two methods
  in conjunction. This is likely due to their complexity and lack of software that
  allows capturing the full social life of someone while keeping the burden for participants
  and researchers sufficiently low. In this article, we report on the development
  of methodology and software for an ESM/PSN integration within the established ESM
  tool m-Path. We describe results of a first study using the developed tool that
  illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method combination and show that participants
  consider the assessments insightful. We further outline study-design choices and
  ethical considerations when combining the two methodologies. We hope to encourage
  applications of the presented methods in research and practice across different
  fields.
