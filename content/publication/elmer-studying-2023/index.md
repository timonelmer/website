abstract: Day-to-day social life and mental health are intertwined. Yet, no study
  to date has assessed how the quantity and quality of social interactions in daily
  life are associated with changes in depressive symptoms. This study examines these
  links using multiple-timescale data (iSHAIB data set; N = 133), where the level
  of depressive symptoms was measured before and after three 21-day periods of event-contingent
  experience sampling of individuals’ interpersonal interactions (T = 64,112). We
  find weak between-person effects for interaction quantity and perceiving interpersonal
  warmth of others on changes in depressive symptoms over the 21-day period, but strong
  and robust evidence for overwarming—a novel construct representing the self-perceived
  difference between one’s own and interaction partner’s level of interpersonal warmth.
  The findings highlight the important role qualitative aspects of social interactions
  may play in the progression of individuals’ depressive symptoms.
