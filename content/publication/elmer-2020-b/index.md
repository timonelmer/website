abstract: Social isolation and depression are tightly linked and can reinforce each
  other in a vicious cycle. Yet, the antecedents of this complex cycle are not well
  understood. To date, little is known about how the dynamics of social isolation
  in daily life (i.e., solitude) play a role in this cycle. To investigate these complex
  dynamics, we introduce the concept of solitude inertia, which captures individuals'
  tendencies to remain in social states of solitude. We argue that, although short-term
  solitude can have both positive and negative effects on individuals' depressive
  symptoms, prolonged states of solitude (i.e., high solitude inertia) are detrimental.
  At the same time, individuals with depression might be more vulnerable to \"get
  stuck\" in solitude. In this study, we tease apart the bidirectional relationship
  between solitude inertia and depressive symptoms. We use data from the MindMaastricht
  study in which 129 individuals with residual depressive symptoms participated in
  two experience sampling assessments phases (T1 and T2) that were 8 weeks apart (Nobs
  = 11,558). Using logistic multilevel models, we find that higher levels of depressive
  symptoms are related to higher solitude inertia. We further show that depressive
  symptoms at T1 are not predictive of solitude inertia at T2. However, solitude inertia
  at T1 was predictive of depressive symptoms eight weeks later (T2) in a linear regression
  analysis. This study introduces and highlights the role of solitude inertia as a
  potential intervention target in social isolation and depression dynamics.
