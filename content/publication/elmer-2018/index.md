abstract: AIMS Informal coercion is a frequently used form of communication among
  mental health professionals to influence treatment outcomes. This study investigates
  the recognition, attitude, and application of different forms of informal coercion
  by mental health professionals.   METHODS Mental health professionals of five psychiatric
  institutions in Germany and Switzerland (n = 424) took part in an online survey
  assessing the recognition of, attitudes towards, and application of different forms
  of informal coercion.   RESULTS Mental health professionals did not recognize the
  extent of informal coercion adequately; especially stronger forms were underestimated.
  Recognition and application of informal coercion was predicted by attitudes towards
  coercion. Furthermore, there were differences between profession of participants
  regarding the recognition and application of informal coercion.   CONCLUSIONS It
  is important to realize that the extent of applied informal coercion in therapeutic
  communication is often not recognized by practitioners, although it might interfere
  with a sound therapeutic relationship.
