abstract: MDMA is a recreational drug commonly used to enhance euphoria, but it is
  also used in non-party settings with self-insight or social connection intentions.
  Yet, little is known about whether distinct consumer groups are formed based on
  consumption setting and intention. We aimed to characterize different types of recreational
  MDMA users based on consumption setting and intentions, and to examine their differences
  in perceptions of long-term social-emotional effects of MDMA use. We analyzed self-reports
  of 766 individuals (ages 18–61, mostly from Western countries), reporting on their
  MDMA consumption habits and perceived effects. We used a K-medoids clustering algorithm
  to identify distinct types of consumption settings and intentions. We identified
  three setting types – party settings with friends (N = 388), private home settings
  (N = 132), mixed settings (N = 246) – and three intention types – euphoria and energy
  (N = 302), self-insight (N = 219), mixed intentions (N = 245). Members of the self-insight
  and mixed intentions clusters reported considerably more long-term socio-emotional
  benefits than members of the euphoria and energy cluster. No differences were observed
  between the setting clusters. In this particular sample, more long-term benefits
  than harms were reported. Our findings suggest that the long-term social-emotional
  benefits of MDMA are associated with whether users seek self-insight or have mixed
  intentions.
