abstract: 'This study examines how communication modality influences social interaction
  quality and its contingency on three other situational characteris­ tics: physical
  location, partner familiarity, and interaction purpose. Data from two experience
  sampling studies including 385 Spanish emerging adults and 10,203 social interaction
  reports revealed that compared to face-to-face interactions, phone calls were rated
  higher, video calls showed no significant difference, and text-based and social
  media interactions (e.g., commenting) were rated lower. However, other situational
  factors mattered. For example, video calls at home were perceived as higher in quality
  than face-to-face, whereas face-to-face was superior outside the home. For partner
  familiarity, social media interactions with weak (vs. strong) ties were of significantly
  lower quality. For interaction purpose, text­ ing was superior to face-to-face in
  leveraging social interaction quality when having negative (vs. maintenance) interactions.
  Combined, the results thus plead for greater consideration of the situation when
  examining the effects of (mediated) interpersonal communication.'
