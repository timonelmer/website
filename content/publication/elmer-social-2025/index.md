abstract: 'Background: Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) aim to provide
  psychological support during critical moments in daily life. Objective: This preregistered
  study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a social support JITAI for individuals
  with subclinical and clinical levels of depressive symptoms awaiting psychotherapy.
  Triggered by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) reports, the intervention encouraged
  participants to activate their (digital) social support networks. Methods: A total
  of 25 participants completed 2689 EMA surveys and received 377 JITAIs over an 18-day
  intervention period, including a microrandomized trial, to compare 4 strategies
  to trigger an intervention: fixed cutoff points of distress variables, personalized
  thresholds (through Shewhart control charts) of distress variables, momentary support
  need, and no intervention. Results: The results showed high feasibility, with participants
  completing 85.37% (2689/3150) of the EMA surveys, exhibiting a low study-related
  attrition rate (7%; total attrition rate was 17%), and reporting minimal technical
  issues. Engagement and perceived helpfulness were heterogeneous and moderate, with
  participants seeking support in one-third of the instances after an intervention
  was triggered instances. JITAIs triggered by self-reported need for support were
  rated as more appropriately timed, helpful, and effective for promoting support-seeking
  behavior compared to those based on distress indicators, despite being triggered
  less frequently. Barriers, such as time constraints and perceived unavailability
  of support providers, likely affected support-seeking behavior, as indicated by
  additional qualitative analyses. Exploratory effectiveness analyses indicated Cohen
  d effect sizes between 0.06 and 0.14 in reducing distress after JITAIs were received.
  Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that a social support JITAI
  is feasible to implement, with high compliance and minimal technical issues. However,
  further research is needed to evaluate the JITAIâ€™s effectiveness and optimize trigger
  strategies in addressing individual needs for and barriers to engagement.'
