abstract: textlessptextgreaterAlthough the lack of conceptual clarity has been observed
  to be a widespread and fundamental problem in psychology, conceptual clarification
  plays a mostly marginal role in psychological research. In this article, we argue
  that better conceptualization of psychological phenomena is needed to move psychology
  forward as a science. We first show how conceptual unclarity seeps through all aspects
  of psychological research, from everyday concepts to statistical measures. We then
  turn to recommendations on how to improve conceptual clarity in psychology, emphasizing
  the importance of seeing research as an iterative process in which it is necessary
  to revisit the phenomena that are the foundations of theories and models, as well
  as how they are conceptualized and measured.textless/ptextgreater
