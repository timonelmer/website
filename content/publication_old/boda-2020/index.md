abstract: Informal social relations, such as friendships, are crucial for the well-being
  and success of students at all levels of education. Network interventions can aim
  at providing contact opportunities in school settings to prevent the social isolation
  of individuals and facilitate integration between otherwise segregated social groups.
  We investigate the short-term and long-term effects of one specific network intervention
  in an undergraduate cohort freshly admitted to an engineering department (N=226).
  In this intervention, we randomly assigned students into small groups at an introduction
  event two months prior to their first day at university. The groups were designed
  to increase mixed-gender contact opportunities. Two months after the intervention,
  we find a higher rate of friendships, common friends, and mixed-gender friendships
  in pairs of students who were assigned to the same group than in pairs from different
  groups (short-term effects). These effects gradually diminish over the first academic
  year (long-term effects). Using stochastic actor-oriented models, we investigate
  the long-term trajectory of the intervention effects, while considering alternative
  network processes, such as reciprocity, transitivity, homophily, and popularity.
  The results suggest that even though the induced friendship ties are less stable
  than other friendships, they may serve as early seeds for complex social network
  processes. Our study shows that simple network interventions can have a pronounced
  short-term effect and indirect long-term effects on the evolution and structure
  of student communities.
