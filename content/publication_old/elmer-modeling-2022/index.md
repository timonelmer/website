abstract: More and more data are being collected using combined active (e.g., surveys)
  and passive (e.g., smartphone sensors) ambulatory assessment methods. Fine-grained
  temporal data, such as smartphone sensor data, allow gaining new insights into the
  dynamics of social interactions in day-to-day life and how these are associated
  with psychosocial phenomena – such as loneliness. So far, however, smartphone sensor
  data have often been aggregated over time, thus, not doing justice to the fine-grained
  temporality of these data. In this article, we demonstrate how time-stamped sensor
  data of social interactions can be modeled with multistate survival models. We examine
  how loneliness is associated with (a) the time between social interaction (i.e.,
  interaction rate) and (b) the duration of social interactions in a student population
  (N participants = 45, N observations = 74,645). Before a 10-week ambulatory assessment
  phase, participants completed the UCLA loneliness scale, covering subscales on intimate,
  relational, and collective loneliness. Results from the multistate survival models
  indicated that loneliness subscales were not significantly associated with differences
  in social interaction rate and duration – only relational loneliness predicted shorter
  social interaction encounters. These findings illustrate how the combination of
  new measurement and modeling methods can advance knowledge on social interaction
  dynamics in daily life settings and how they relate to psychosocial phenomena such
  as loneliness.
