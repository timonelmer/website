abstract: 'The Swiss StudentLife Study (SSL Study) is a longitudinal social network
  data collection conducted in three undergraduate student cohorts (N1 = 226, N2 =
  261, N3 = 660) in 2016−2019. The main goal of the study was to understand the emergence
  of informal student communities and their effects on different individual outcomes,
  such as well-being, motivation, and academic success. To this end, multiple dimensions
  of social ties were assessed, combining computer-based surveys, social sensors,
  social media data, and field experiments. The dynamics of these social networks
  were measured on various time scales. In this paper, we present the design and data
  collection strategy of the SSL Study. We discuss practical challenges and solutions
  related to the data collection in four areas that were key to the success of our
  project: study design, research ethics, communication, and population definition.'
