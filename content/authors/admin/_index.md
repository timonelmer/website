Hi. I'm Timon. You are on my academic website. There <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/hrBwvnvKIxA52/giphy.gif"> could</a> be websites about other interets of mine too, but for now lets talk academics: I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://sn.ethz.ch/">Social Networks lab</a> of the ETH Zürich, where I conduct <b>research on the interplay between (in-person and digital) social network dynamics and people's mental health</b>.
 Before that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.laurabringmannlab.com/">Laura Bringmann lab</a> of the University of Groningen. At some point, I studied Psychology at the University of Basel and University of Zürich and received a PhD from the ETH Zürich.
