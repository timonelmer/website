<!-- My research focuses on the development and application of <b>methods to study social interactions dynamics </b>in daily life with the aim to understand how these contribute to <b>mental health</b>.  -->

Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of Groningen (Netherlands) and ETH Zürich (Switzerland). I studied Psychology at the University of Basel (BSc) and University of Zürich (MSc) and received a PhD from the ETH Zürich. 

<!-- Hi. I'm Timon. You are on my academic website. There <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/hrBwvnvKIxA52/giphy.gif"> could</a> be websites about other interets of mine too, but for now lets talk academics: I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://sn.ethz.ch/">Social Networks lab</a> of the ETH Zürich. In my research I aim to  

<b>(a) develop measurement and modeling methods to study social interaction dynamics

(b) better understand the dynamics between social networks and mental health in order to develop effective psychosocial interventions</b>.<a rel="me" href="https://home.social/@timonelmer"></a> -->
