	abstract = {AIMS
Informal coercion is a frequently used form of communication among mental health professionals to influence treatment outcomes. This study investigates the recognition, attitude, and application of different forms of informal coercion by mental health professionals. 

METHODS
Mental health professionals of five psychiatric institutions in Germany and Switzerland (n = 424) took part in an online survey assessing the recognition of, attitudes towards, and application of different forms of informal coercion. 

RESULTS
Mental health professionals did not recognize the extent of informal coercion adequately; especially stronger forms were underestimated. Recognition and application of informal coercion was predicted by attitudes towards coercion. Furthermore, there were differences between profession of participants regarding the recognition and application of informal coercion. 

CONCLUSIONS
It is important to realize that the extent of applied informal coercion in therapeutic communication is often not recognized by practitioners, although it might interfere with a sound therapeutic relationship.},

	abstract = {Successful teamwork is an important factor for positive outcomes at the organizational and the individual level. Best results should be expected when every team member can contribute his or her specific set of strengths and skills, with all of the necessary skills being present in a team. Recently a new model of team roles developed from a positive psychological perspective has been suggested comprising of 7 informal team roles. The present study examines the relevance of role-fit between roles displayed in the current team and roles displayed in an ideal team on a person’s job satisfaction and calling. For this purpose, a sample of N = 342 employed participants who took part in an online survey were analyzed. Results show that most current team roles contribute to job satisfaction and calling, whereas only few relationships are found with ideal roles. Further, the interplay between current and ideal role behavior is relevant for job satisfaction in most team roles, but only for few roles with regard to calling. Thus, both current and ideal team roles are relevant for work-related outcomes; this information could potentially be used as a starting point for positive interventions at the workplace.

Assumptions underlying centrality indices, such as presence of a flow and shortest paths, may not correspond with a general theory of how psychological variables relate to one another. Furthermore, the assumptions of node distinctiveness and node exchangeability may not hold in psychological networks. We conclude that, for psychological networks, especially betweenness and closeness centrality seem unsuitable as measures of node importance. We therefore suggest three ways forward: (1) using centrality measures that are tailored to the psychological network context, (2) reconsidering existing measures of importance used in statistical models underlying psychological networks, and (3) leaving the whole idea of node centrality behind. Foremost, we argue that one has to make explicit what is meant with being central and what assumptions the centrality measure of choice entails to make sure that there is a match between the process under study and the centrality measure that is used.},

Although the composition of such groups has received ample attention in various fields-e.g., sociology, social psychology, management, and educational science-their micro-level dynamics are rarely analyzed empirically. In this article, we present a new statistical network model (DyNAM-i) that can represent the dynamics of conversation groups and interpersonal interaction in different social contexts. Taking an actor-oriented perspective, this model can be applied to test how individuals' interaction patterns differ and how they choose and change their interaction groups. It moves beyond dyadic interaction mechanisms and translates central social network mechanisms-such as homophily, transitivity, and popularity-to the context of interactions in group settings. The utility and practical applicability of the new model are illustrated in two social network studies that investigate face-to-face interactions in a small party and an office setting.},

Network interventions can aim at providing contact opportunities in school settings to prevent the social isolation of individuals and facilitate integration between otherwise segregated social groups. We investigate the short-term and long-term effects of one specific network intervention in an undergraduate cohort freshly admitted to an engineering department (N=226). In this intervention, we randomly assigned students into small groups at an introduction event two months prior to their first day at university. The groups were designed to increase mixed-gender contact opportunities. Two months after the intervention, we find a higher rate of friendships, common friends, and mixed-gender friendships in pairs of students who were assigned to the same group than in pairs from different groups (short-term effects). These effects gradually diminish over the first academic year (long-term effects). Using stochastic actor-oriented models, we investigate the long-term trajectory of the intervention effects, while considering alternative network processes, such as reciprocity, transitivity, homophily, and popularity. The results suggest that even though the induced friendship ties are less stable than other friendships, they may serve as early seeds for complex social network processes. Our study shows that simple network interventions can have a pronounced short-term effect and indirect long-term effects on the evolution and structure of student communities.},

	abstract = {Academic success of students has been explained with a variety of individual and socioeconomic factors. Social networks that informally emerge within student communities can have an additional effect on their achievement. However, this effect of social ties is difficult to measure and quantify, because social networks are multidimensional and dynamically evolving within the educational context. We repeatedly surveyed a cohort of 226 engineering undergraduates between their first day at university and a crucial examination at the end of the academic year. We investigate how social networks emerge between previously unacquainted students and how integration in these networks explains academic success. Our study measures multiple important dimensions of social ties between students: their positive interactions, friendships, and studying relations. By using statistical models for dynamic network data, we are able to investigate the processes of social network formation in the cohort. We find that friendship ties informally evolve into studying relationships over the academic year. This process is crucial, as studying together with others, in turn, has a strong impact on students' success at the examination. The results are robust to individual differences in socioeconomic background factors and to various indirect measures of cognitive abilities, such as prior academic achievement and being perceived as smart by other students. The findings underline the importance of understanding social network dynamics in educational settings. They call for the creation of university environments promoting the development of positive relationships in pursuit of academic success.},

To date, little is known about how the dynamics of social isolation in daily life (i.e., solitude) play a role in this cycle. To investigate these complex dynamics, we introduce the concept of solitude inertia, which captures individuals' tendencies to remain in social states of solitude. We argue that, although short-term solitude can have both positive and negative effects on individuals' depressive symptoms, prolonged states of solitude (i.e., high solitude inertia) are detrimental. At the same time, individuals with depression might be more vulnerable to "get stuck" in solitude. In this study, we tease apart the bidirectional relationship between solitude inertia and depressive symptoms. We use data from the MindMaastricht study in which 129 individuals with residual depressive symptoms participated in two experience sampling assessments phases (T1 and T2) that were 8 weeks apart (Nobs = 11,558). Using logistic multilevel models, we find that higher levels of depressive symptoms are related to higher solitude inertia. We further show that depressive symptoms at T1 are not predictive of solitude inertia at T2. However, solitude inertia at T1 was predictive of depressive symptoms eight weeks later (T2) in a linear regression analysis. This study introduces and highlights the role of solitude inertia as a potential intervention target in social isolation and depression dynamics.},

Results showed that ACP were not less popular than adolescents without chronic pain. Second, ACP nominated each other more often as being part of the same peer group. Third, results regarding friendship quality showed that adolescents with more pain problems perceived the relationship with their friends as less positive (eg, support) and more negative (eg, conflict) than adolescents with less pain problems. Finally, positive and negative friendship qualities moderated the relationship between pain and emotional distress.

We analyze change on multiple dimensions of social networks (interaction, friendship, social support, co-studying) and mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness) within two cohorts of Swiss undergraduate students experiencing the crisis (N = 212), and make additional comparisons to an earlier cohort which did not experience the crisis (N = 54). In within-person comparisons we find that interaction and co-studying networks had become sparser, and more students were studying alone. Furthermore, students' levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms got worse, compared to measures before the crisis. Stressors shifted from fears of missing out on social life to worries about health, family, friends, and their future. Exploratory analyses suggest that COVID-19 specific worries, isolation in social networks, lack of interaction and emotional support, and physical isolation were associated with negative mental health trajectories. Female students appeared to have worse mental health trajectories when controlling for different levels of social integration and COVID-19 related stressors. As universities and researchers discuss future strategies on how to combine on-site teaching with online courses, our results indicate the importance of considering social contacts in students' mental health and offer starting points to identify and support students at higher risk of social isolation and negative psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Fine-grained temporal data, such as smartphone sensor data, allow gaining new insights into the dynamics of social interactions in day-to-day life and how these are associated with psychosocial phenomena – such as loneliness. So far, however, smartphone sensor data have often been aggregated over time, thus, not doing justice to the fine-grained temporality of these data. In this article, we demonstrate how time-stamped sensor data of social interactions can be modeled with multistate survival models. We examine how loneliness is associated with (a) the time between social interaction (i.e., interaction rate) and (b) the duration of social interactions in a student population (N

Results from the multistate survival models indicated that loneliness subscales were not significantly associated with differences in social interaction rate and duration – only relational loneliness predicted shorter social interaction encounters. These findings illustrate how the combination of new measurement and modeling methods can advance knowledge on social interaction dynamics in daily life settings and how they relate to psychosocial phenomena such as loneliness.},

We first show how conceptual unclarity seeps through all aspects of psychological research, from everyday concepts to statistical measures. We then turn to recommendations on how to improve conceptual clarity in psychology, emphasizing the importance of seeing research as an iterative process in which it is necessary to revisit the phenomena that are the foundations of theories and models, as well as how they are conceptualized and measured.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The social context of a person, meaning their social relationships and daily social interactions, is an important factor for understanding their mental health. However, personalised feedback approaches to psychotherapy do not consider this factor sufficiently yet. Therefore, we developed an interactive feedback prototype focusing specifically on a person’s social relationships as captured with personal social networks (PSN) and daily social interactions as captured with experience sampling methodology (ESM). We describe the development of the prototype as well as two evaluation studies: Semistructured interviews with students (N = 23) and a focus group discussion with five psychotherapy patients. Participants from both studies considered the prototype useful. The students considered participation in our study, which included social context assessment via PSN and ESM as well as a feedback session, insightful. However, it remains unclear how much insight the feedback procedure generated for the students beyond the insights they already gained from the assessments. The focus group patients indicated that in a clinical context, (social context) feedback may be especially useful to generate insight for the clinician and facilitate collaboration between patient and clinician. Furthermore, it became clear that the current feedback prototype requires explanations by a researcher or trained clinician and cannot function as a stand-alone intervention. As such, we discuss our feedback prototype as a starting point for future research and clinical implementation.},

	abstract = {The depth of information collected in participants’ daily lives with active (e.g., experience sampling surveys) and passive (e.g., smartphone sensors) ambulatory measurement methods is immense. When measuring participants’ behaviors in daily life, the timing of particular events—such as social interactions—is often recorded. These data facilitate the investigation of new types of research questions about the timing of those events, including whether individuals’ affective state is associated with the rate of social interactions (binary event occurrence) and what types of social interactions are likely to occur (multicategory event occurrences, e.g., interactions with friends or family). Although survival analysis methods have been used to analyze time-to-event data in longitudinal settings for several decades, these methods have not yet been incorporated into ambulatory assessment research. This article illustrates how multilevel and multistate survival analysis methods can be used to model the social interaction dynamics captured in intensive longitudinal data, specifically when individuals exhibit particular categories of behavior. We provide an introduction to these models and a tutorial on how the timing and type of social interactions can be modeled using the R statistical programming language. Using event-contingent reports (N = 150, Nevents = 64,112) obtained in an ambulatory study of interpersonal interactions, we further exemplify an empirical application case. In sum, this article demonstrates how survival models can advance the understanding of (social interaction) dynamics that unfold in daily life.

	abstract = {Puberty is a phase in which individuals often test the boundaries of themselves and surrounding others and further deﬁne their identity – and thus their uniqueness compared to other individuals. Similarly, as Computational Social Science (CSS) grows up, it must strike a balance between its own practices and those of neighboring disciplines to achieve scientiﬁc rigor and reﬁne its identity. However, there are certain areas within CSS that are reluctant to adopt rigorous scientiﬁc practices from other ﬁelds, which can be observed through an overreliance on passively collected data (e.g., through digital traces, wearables) without questioning the validity of such data. This paper argues that CSS should embrace the potential of combining both passive and active measurement practices to capitalize on the strengths of each approach, including objectivity and psychological quality. Additionally, the paper suggests that CSS would beneﬁt from integrating practices and knowledge from other established disciplines, such as measurement validation, theoretical embedding, and open science practices. Based on this argument, the paper provides ten recommendations for CSS to mature as an interdisciplinary ﬁeld of research.},

We find weak between-person effects for interaction quantity and perceiving interpersonal warmth of others on changes in depressive symptoms over the 21-day period, but strong and robust evidence for overwarming—a novel construct representing the self-perceived difference between one’s own and interaction partner’s level of interpersonal warmth.

Yet, little is known about whether distinct consumer groups are formed based on consumption setting and intention. We aimed to characterize different types of recreational MDMA users based on consumption setting and intentions, and to examine their differences in perceptions of long-term social-emotional effects of MDMA use. We analyzed self-reports of 766 individuals (ages 18–61, mostly from Western countries), reporting on their MDMA consumption habits and perceived effects. We used a K-medoids clustering algorithm to identify distinct types of consumption settings and intentions. We identified three setting types – party settings with friends (N = 388), private home settings (N = 132), mixed settings (N = 246) – and three intention types – euphoria and energy (N = 302), self-insight (N = 219), mixed intentions (N = 245). Members of the self-insight and mixed intentions clusters reported considerably more long-term socio-emotional benefits than members of the euphoria and energy cluster. No differences were observed between the setting clusters. In this particular sample, more long-term benefits than harms were reported. Our findings suggest that the long-term social-emotional benefits of MDMA are associated with whether users seek self-insight or have mixed intentions.},

Two methods that are especially promising are personal-social-network (PSN) data collection and experience-sampling methodology (ESM). Whereas PSN data collections ask participants to provide information on their social relationships and broader social environment, ESM studies collect intensive longitudinal data on social interactions in daily life using multiple short surveys per day. In combination, the two methods enable detailed insights into someone?s social life, including information on interactions with specific interaction partners from the personal network. Despite many potential uses of such data integration, there are few studies to date using the two methods in conjunction. This is likely due to their complexity and lack of software that allows capturing the full social life of someone while keeping the burden for participants and researchers sufficiently low. In this article, we report on the development of methodology and software for an ESM/PSN integration within the established ESM tool m-Path. We describe results of a first study using the developed tool that illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method combination and show that participants consider the assessments insightful. We further outline study-design choices and ethical considerations when combining the two methodologies. We hope to encourage applications of the presented methods in research and practice across different fields.},

	abstract = {Objective: Despite the importance for understanding mechanisms of change, little is known about the order of change in daily life emotions, cognitions, and behaviors during treatment of depression. This study examined the within-person temporal order of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral improvements using ecological momentary assessment data. Method: Thirty-two individuals with diagnosed depression completed ecological momentary assessment questions on emotions (sad mood, happy mood), behaviors (social interaction, number of activities), and cognitive variables (worrying, negative self-thoughts) 5 times a day during a 4-month period in which they underwent psychotherapy for depression. Nonparametric change-point analyses were used to determine the timing of gains (i.e., improvements in the mean of each variable) for each individual. We then established whether the first (i.e., earliest) gains in emotions preceded, followed, or occurred in the same week as cognitive and behavioral gains for each individual. Results: Contrary to our hypotheses, first gains in behaviors did not precede first emotional gains (3 times, 8\%) more often than they followed them (26 times, 70\%). Cognitive gains often occurred in the same week as first emotional gains (43 times, 58\%) and less often preceded (13 times, 18\%) or followed emotional gains (18 times, 24\%). Conclusion: The first improvements in behaviors did not tend to precede the first improvements in emotions likely because fewer behavioral gains were found. The finding that cognitive variables tend to improve around the same time as sad mood may explain why many studies failed to find that cognitive change predicts later change in depressive symptoms.

Such digital interactions  – containing limited physical cues – may yield distinct effects on interaction quality and post-interaction emotional states compared to face-to-face exchanges. In this study, we examine four preregistered hypotheses on the within-person interplay between interaction mode (i.e., digital vs. face-to-face interactions), interaction quality, and momentary well-being. We use data from two samples (N1 = 216, N2 = 21) with  T1 = 5116 and T2 = 1348 Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) of interaction mode, interaction quality, and different momentary well-being measures (i.e., affect valence, loneliness, positive affect, negative affect). Estimating multilevel mediation Structural Equation Models, we find no within-person differences in interaction quality between digital and face-to-face interactions in Sample I. Contrary to our expectations, the quality of interaction in Sample II was rated higher during digital interactions than face-to-face interactions. Interaction quality was positively associated with momentary well-being measures in both samples. Momentary well-being was higher after face-to-face interactions than digital interactions in Sample I, but not in Sample II. Interaction quality did not mediate the relationship between interaction mode and momentary well-being – rather, it moderated the relationship in Sample I. As we do not observe evidence for a mediating effect, it remains an open empirical question through which pathways digital social interactions differ from face-to-face interactions in their effect on momentary well-being.},

We analyze two data sets (N = 123) of face-to-face interaction events (N = 86,915) collected with proximity badges at a social event. Hypotheses are tested using a relational event model (DyNAM-i) specifically tailored for modeling group interactions. In line with the dyadic preference hypotheses, individuals with higher levels of depressive symptoms are found to be more likely to join and stay in dyadic interactions. Post hoc analyses reveal that this result only applies to female participants. We find limited support for the depression avoidance hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Given the pervasive role of smartphones in modern life, research into their impact on well-being has ﬂourished. This study addresses existing methodological shortcomings using smartphone log data and experience sampling methods (ESM) to explore the bidirectional within-person relationship between smartphone usage and momentary well-being variables (i.e., affect valence, loneliness, positive affect, and negative affect). We further examine different categories of smartphone usage, namely, communication, social media, and other apps. We analyze three samples (N1 = 225, N2 = 17, N3 = 13; with T1 = 7,874, T2 = 2,566, T3 = 1,533 ESM reports) with multilevel models to test our preregistered hypotheses. Data for Sample I were collected in Spain in 2022 (82\% female; Mage = 23.1). Samples II and III (80\% female; Mage = 21.6) were collected in the Netherlands between 2021 and 2022. Our results suggest that smartphone usage within an hour before ESM assessment, especially using social media apps, is associated with reduced affect valence and increased loneliness on a within-person level. Loneliness was associated with more smartphone usage than usual, particularly the use of social media apps, within the hour following ESM assessments. However, overall, our ﬁndings indicate weak bidirectional associations between smartphone usage and indicators of momentary well-being (range standardized β = .00–.08). On the between-person level, those individuals generally high in loneliness were more affected in their momentary loneliness by prior social media use, suggesting a heightened social media sensitivity. The interplay between social media use and momentary loneliness should be studied in more detail, including contextual factors and experimental designs.},

	abstract = {Causal inference methods for treatment eﬀect estimation usually assume independent units. However, this assumption is often questionable because units may interact, resulting in spillover eﬀects between them. We develop augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) for estimation and inference of the expected average treatment eﬀect (EATE) with observational data from a single (social) network with spillover eﬀects. In contrast to overall eﬀects such as the global average treatment eﬀect, the EATE measures, in expectation and on average over all units, how the outcome of a unit is causally aﬀected by its own treatment, marginalizing over the spillover eﬀects from other units. We develop cross-ﬁtting theory with plugin machine learning to obtain a semiparametric treatment eﬀect estimator that converges at the parametric rate and asymptotically follows a Gaussian distribution. The asymptotics are developed using the dependency graph rather than the network graph, which makes explicit that we allow for spillover eﬀects beyond immediate neighbors in the network. We apply our AIPW method to the Swiss StudentLife Study data to investigate the eﬀect of hours spent studying on exam performance accounting for the students’ social network.},

	abstract = {This study examines how communication modality influences social interaction quality and its contingency on three other situational characteris­ tics: physical location, partner familiarity, and interaction purpose. Data from two experience sampling studies including 385 Spanish emerging adults and 10,203 social interaction reports revealed that compared to face-to-face interactions, phone calls were rated higher, video calls showed no significant difference, and text-based and social media interactions (e.g., commenting) were rated lower. However, other situational factors mattered. For example, video calls at home were perceived as higher in quality than face-to-face, whereas face-to-face was superior outside the home. For partner familiarity, social media interactions with weak (vs. strong) ties were of significantly lower quality. For interaction purpose, text­ ing was superior to face-to-face in leveraging social interaction quality when having negative (vs. maintenance) interactions. Combined, the results thus plead for greater consideration of the situation when examining the effects of (mediated) interpersonal communication.},

	abstract = {Many daily social interactions take place digitally, for example via video calls or texts. Such digital interactions  – containing limited physical cues – may yield distinct effects on interaction quality and post-interaction emotional states compared to face-to-face exchanges. In this study, we examine four preregistered hypotheses on the within-person interplay between interaction mode (i.e., digital vs. face-to-face interactions), interaction quality, and momentary well-being. We use data from two samples (N1 = 216, N2 = 21) with  T1 = 5116 and T2 = 1348 Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) of interaction mode, interaction quality, and different momentary well-being measures (i.e., affect valence, loneliness, positive affect, negative affect). Estimating multilevel mediation Structural Equation Models, we find no within-person differences in interaction quality between digital and face-to-face interactions in Sample I. Contrary to our expectations, the quality of interaction in Sample II was rated higher during digital interactions than face-to-face interactions. Interaction quality was positively associated with momentary well-being measures in both samples. Momentary well-being was higher after face-to-face interactions than digital interactions in Sample I, but not in Sample II. Interaction quality did not mediate the relationship between interaction mode and momentary well-being – rather, it moderated the relationship in Sample I. As we do not observe evidence for a mediating effect, it remains an open empirical question through which pathways digital social interactions differ from face-to-face interactions in their effect on momentary well-being.},

	abstract = {Background: Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) aim to provide psychological support during critical moments in daily life.
Objective: This preregistered study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a social support JITAI for individuals with subclinical and clinical levels of depressive symptoms awaiting psychotherapy. Triggered by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) reports, the intervention encouraged participants to activate their (digital) social support networks.
Methods: A total of 25 participants completed 2689 EMA surveys and received 377 JITAIs over an 18-day intervention period, including a microrandomized trial, to compare 4 strategies to trigger an intervention: fixed cutoff points of distress variables, personalized thresholds (through Shewhart control charts) of distress variables, momentary support need, and no intervention.
Results: The results showed high feasibility, with participants completing 85.37\% (2689/3150) of the EMA surveys, exhibiting a low study-related attrition rate (7\%; total attrition rate was 17\%), and reporting minimal technical issues. Engagement and perceived helpfulness were heterogeneous and moderate, with participants seeking support in one-third of the instances after an intervention was triggered instances. JITAIs triggered by self-reported need for support were rated as more appropriately timed, helpful, and effective for promoting support-seeking behavior compared to those based on distress indicators, despite being triggered less frequently. Barriers, such as time constraints and perceived unavailability of support providers, likely affected support-seeking behavior, as indicated by additional qualitative analyses. Exploratory effectiveness analyses indicated Cohen d effect sizes between 0.06 and 0.14 in reducing distress after JITAIs were received.
Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that a social support JITAI is feasible to implement, with high compliance and minimal technical issues. However, further research is needed to evaluate the JITAI’s effectiveness and optimize trigger strategies in addressing individual needs for and barriers to engagement.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the feasibility and usage patterns of the Safespace AI chatbot, an AI-driven smartphone application that offers an LLM-powered interactive chatbot to support mental health. We explored usage patterns and their associations with pre-intervention depressive symptoms in a sample of 20 university students who used the chatbot over two to four weeks. First, we find that those with elevated depression scores were significantly more likely to emotionally open up during their interactions with the chatbot. Second, usage patterns demonstrated that the highest levels of interaction occurred early in the morning and late at night, when peer and professional support may be inaccessible. Third, students who engaged more frequently with the chatbot exhibited worse pre-intervention depressive symptoms. The difference large but statistically not significant, but hints a relevant difference to explore with further data collection. These findings provide initial insights on the utility and engagement dynamics of Safespace and highlight directions for future research to optimize AI-driven mental health interventions.},
